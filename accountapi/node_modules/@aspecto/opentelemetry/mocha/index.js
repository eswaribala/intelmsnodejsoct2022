 * We want users to be able to use this package as mocha plugin with this syntax:
 * mocha --require @aspecto/opentelemetry/mocha

 * Since typescript is compiling our code into "dist/src", directory,
 * and we don't want to have this in what user need to type,
 * we add this file at the root of the package to solve this issue.
 *
 * The real logic is found in the src/mocha/index.ts file
